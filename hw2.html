                        <p class="lyrics">There's a port on a western bay
                            And it serves a hundred ships a day
                            Lonely sailors pass the time away
                            And talk about their homes
                            And there's a girl in this harbor town
                            And she works layin' whiskey down
                            They say, Brandy, fetch another round
                            She serves them whiskey and wine
                            The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
                            "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
                            "Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"
                            Brandy wears a braided chain
                            Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
                            A locket that bears the name
                            Of the man that Brandy loved
                            He came on a summer's day
                            Bringin' gifts from far away
                            But he made it clear he couldn't stay
                            No harbor was his home
                            The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
                            "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
                            "But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
                            Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
                            When he told his sailor stories
                            She could feel the ocean fall and rise
                            She saw its ragin' glory
                            But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
                            And Brandy does her best to understand
                            At night when the bars close down
                            Brandy walks through a silent town
                            And loves a man who's not around
                            She still can hear him say
                            She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
                            "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
                            "But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
                            It is, yes it is
                            He said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
                            "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
                            "But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
                        </p>

            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>This week we learned alot about the power of CSS. CSS allows us to design and alter
                our website in any way we want. Change sizes, colors, dimensions, pretty much anything
                goes. Next we learned about adding interactive parts to our websites such as videos, mp3s, images,
            these types of things make the website more enjoyable for the people who visit it.  </p>
